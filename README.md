# Brutalizer

This was a project built in a couple of hours to test out Cursor.
Will not be hosting this, but feel free to clone and run locally as a website.
I would have made the website more aesthetically pleasing, but this was just a 
test of Cursor to see its capabilities in action in a limited timeframe.
Although it was just a test, I will be using this from time to time
as I work on learning Photoshop / graphic design, since I do
genuinely like some of the effects. That being said,
there are some effects added solely because I can, and so
they are not the most useful. At the end of the day, a lot of grinding
computer science is like that anyways though; doing useless things
just to say that you could. So, at the end of the day, even if this
tool serves no real purpose since there are far better and more-polished
applications out there, at least I've learned a lot, and hopefully you
will too. That being said, I'm not sure if any of this makes sense
since its 4:32 AM and I've been up since 8 AM, but yeah.
Image editor website, woo hoo oh yeah, comp sci mini project done,
that was honestly pretty fun, second "real" personal project done and
over with, here's to a thousand million trillion more, cheers,
all on that internship/employment grind yeahhhhhhh oh yeah heck yeah we're doin it we're doin it
