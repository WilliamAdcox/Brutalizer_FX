# Brutalizer

This was a project built in a couple of hours to test out Cursor.
Will not be hosting this, but feel free to clone and run locally as a website.
I would have made the website more aesthetically pleasing, but this was just a 
test of Cursor to see its capabilities in action in a limited timeframe.
Although it was just a test, I will be using this from time to time
as I work on learning Photoshop / graphic design, since I do
genuinely like some of the effects. That being said,
there are some effects added solely because I can, and so
they are not the most useful (but, for what it's worth, they work correctly).
